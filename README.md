This repository demonstrates a common Elixir coding error related to modifying a list while iterating over it using Enum.each. The original code attempts to remove elements from a list within the iteration, but due to the immutable nature of Elixir lists, this approach does not work as expected.  The solution demonstrates a correct way to achieve the desired outcome, highlighting the importance of understanding Elixir's functional programming paradigm.
